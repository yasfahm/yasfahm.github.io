        <h4 class="header-text" style="margin-top: 50px">Understanding the Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Human history is often divided into pre and post industrial revolution, but in the future the
            distinguishing landmark will probably be the advent and prevalence of computers. Computers have
            revolutionized the way humans react with their external selves, including other humans.
            But recently, the adverse effects of computers, and particularly screen time, on human
            mental and physical health are under increased scrutiny. Over half the population admits
            excessive use of their smartphones. The problem is particularly grave amongst teens and young-adults,
            leading to problems like anxiety, poor posture, sleep issues, weight gain, risk of heart disease,
            and more at perturbingly younger ages. COVID has exacerbated the already serious problem of screen-addiction and excessive screen time.
            All of these come at the expense of the users’ mental and physical health.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
            The goal is to design an app that promotes a healthier lifestyle for the adults, while ensuring healthier screen habits. It is a
            strangely paradoxical task to design an app that the users spend time operating,
            and yet that aims to reduce the screen time users spend. The challenge grows in the face of covid where
            screen time often provides the only outlet for users to interact with friends and family, an aspect
            undoubtedly paramount to better mental health, and one of the few sources of entertainment.
        </p>
        <h6 class="sub-title" style="margin-top: 30px">Our Solution</h6>
        <p>
            Any and all design solutions should always address the problem of increased screen time. It would be
            easy to just pack the app with features aimed at promoting a healthier lifestyle, like bombardment of
            notifications to log activities, track mental health or suggestions like journaling. However, this
            defeats the purpose as the user must consequently spend an increased amount of time using the app. Instead we
            aim to identify the absolutely crucial tasks that the users must engage in, which would ensure the
            highest amount of time away from the screens, and yet would have the highest positive impact on mental
            and physical health.

                Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone’s daily routine has changed. Whether people
                study from home in front of their computers or they work remotely, almost all their daily tasks
                require a screen. Even though the concept of lifestyle apps are not new, we found flaws and
                features that were not crucial for most users.

                The goal of our app is to encourage users to focus on fulfilling basic needs.
                After gathering the responses, we noticed that most people spend the majority
                of their time in front of screens for entertainment and work. According to Maslow’s
                Hierarchy of Needs, the foundation tier is physiological such as food, water,
                sleep, and warmth. Though we had an idea of incorporating these needs as features,
                it was vital to prove a strong correlation between the users’ necessities and
                our assumptions. The main features are loosely based on these essentials that
                most of us neglect daily due to the current state of the world.

            <p>
                The next step of validating our users was to create personas and trying to
                discover what drives them. Our interview questions were conducted with an
                audience of 18 people. The proposed questions will be used as segments for
                the personas. We focused on the goals, frustrations, interests, and ways of
                improving mental health to envision the types of users for LUMI. To be more
                inclusive of the preferences among users, we added several other features such
                as journaling, medicine, and screen time. LUMI will encourage users to
                customize what makes them happy and will manage all they do to attain that
                aim with its multiple features.

                    The user flow was a useful visual representation that we created to answer both logical and design
                    concerns. There were many questions posed during team discussions to comprehend and be mindful of
                    the user experience. The diagram was formed while responding to concerns such as: logical flow
                    between frames, creative transitions that might confuse users, and avoiding an overwhelming amount
                    of menu options.

                    We agreed on the color blue. The theme for LUMI incorporates different hues of blue. White
                    complements
                    the darker shades of our palette. Blue is a calming color that promotes serenity and stability.
                    It also symbolizes wisdom, depth of understanding, and introspective journey.

                <p>Our first idea was to use pastel colors which is a UI/UX trend in 2021. After multiple brainstorming
                    sessions, we thought it would be a good idea to use different colors for each feature (blue for water, green for nutrition,
                    yellow for sleep, red for exercise, etc). However, after starting the prototype, we realized that
                    having multiple colors on our app will be overwhelming for the user. Therefore, we opted for a minimalistic
                    color palette where we used blue/cyan as accent colors.</p>

        <p>
            When designing LUMI, our main goal was to create an app that can be personalized by the user. We wanted to have
            some features common for every user as well as features that will be specific to each one. Finding the basic features
            was an easy process but choosing other features that may differ from one account to another was a challenge. 
            Each of our features encourage the user to focus on their mental and physical health whether it's by offering a journaling
            section, tracking calories/water intake/sleep, exercising and/or meditating, reminding them to take their
            medication and setting a screen time limit. Throughout this process, we  discovered that each one of us had different definitions of a healthy lifestyle. Thus, trying to find a balance between each of our ideas was also challenging.
