                                Human history is often divided into pre and post industrial revolution, but in the future the 
                                distinguishing landmark will probably be the advent and prevalence of computers. Computers have 
                                revolutionized the way humans react with their external selves, including other humans. For
                                the most part, the change has been positive allowing humans to live fuller and more luxurious
                                lives. But recently, the adverse effects of computers, and particularly screen time, on human
                                mental and physical health are under increased scrutiny. Over half the population admits
                                excessive use of their smartphones. The problem is particularly grave amongst teens and young-adults,
                                leading to problems like anxiety, poor posture, sleep issues, weight gain, risk of heart disease, 
                                and more at perturbingly younger ages.

                                COVID has exacerbated the already serious problem of screen-addiction and excessive screen time. 
                            </p>
                            </br>
                            <p>
                                All of these come at the expense of the usersâ€™ mental and physical health. The goal is to design an 
                                app that promotes a healthier lifestyle for the adults, while ensuring healthier screen habits. With 
                                the certified adverse effects of screen time on personal health, it is crucial to strike a balance 
                                between screen use and fulfillment of basic needs critical to human health like food, water, sleep, 
                                and warmth. It is a strangely paradoxical task to design an app that the users spend time operating, 
                                and yet that aims to reduce the screen time users spend. The challenge grows in the face of covid where 
                                screen time often provides the only outlet for users to interact with friends and family, an aspect 
                                undoubtedly paramount to better mental health,  and one of the few sources of entertainment.

                                        New solutions take more of a seller and buyer initiative. They provide a market place where people can transact openly and transparently with the data.
                                        Buyers are clearly defined, and so are the sellers.

                                    First of all, the companies using conventional solutions, have borderline unethical approach to privacy and personal data.

                                            end users are more concerned about what data is collected. This clearly shows that people have information they would rather not share.
                                            There are a multitude of reasons why this might be the case, therefore we believe it is important to underline which data points has the user agreed to share.

                                        Here we demonstrate the general views of the "Trending" page (requested by our sample user population) as well as the "Search" page which would allow a user to search
                                        for specific companies and/or apply filters to target exactly what the user is trying to sell.

                                       
                                    </p>

                                        Finally, our interviewed sample population clearly desired having direct deposits and this is also want we wanted to highlight in our application to make it stand out.
                                        People want to know that "real" money will be going into their bank accounts once they sell their data.

                                Interview
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                For one, we first decided to conduct interviews as our data gathering technique over other techniques such as questionnaires.
                                Our aim with this decision was to have a more human interaction with our population and probe for explanantion in order to
                                develop a more sound understanding of how our users feel.   
                            </p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            <h5>Storyboard & Journey Map</h5>
                            <p> As a team, we wanted to illustrate a typical story that we feel could actually happen in the real world. A storyboard
                                would be the most effective at doing this and it will allow people to relate to the scenario being described. 

                                Upon completion of our storyboard, we felt like the user experience was not entirely depicted through the sotryboard and hence we wanted to 
                                further illustrate this with a Journey Map to show the users experience while using the application.
                            </p>    
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            <h5>Wireframes</h5>
                            <p> We decided to simply put wireframes to outline the general layout of primary components of the application. We decided against including user-flow
                                diagrams  since we felt the journey map covered the application's interaction and we really wanted to focus on the visual aspect of the application.
                            </p>             
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            <h5>Prototype</h5>
                            <p> The reason we decided to do an interactive prototype was to further highlight the interaction of the application. Although, just showing the mockups 
                                in a static view would also be effective, showing visitors of the website a interactive prototype will allow them to get a better feel for the future application.
