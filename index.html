        <h4 class="header-text" style="margin-top: 50px">Problem</h4>
        <p>
            Human history is often divided into pre and post industrial revolution, but in the future the
            distinguishing landmark will probably be the advent and prevalence of computers. Computers have
            revolutionized the way humans react with their external selves, including other humans.
            But recently, the adverse effects of computers, and particularly screen time, on human
            mental and physical health are under increased scrutiny. Over half the population admits
            excessive use of their smartphones. The problem is particularly grave amongst teens and young-adults,
            leading to problems like anxiety, poor posture, sleep issues, weight gain, risk of heart disease,
            and more at perturbingly younger ages.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
            The goal is to design an
            app that promotes a healthier lifestyle for the adults, while ensuring healthier screen habits. It is a
            strangely paradoxical task to design an app that the users spend time operating,
            and yet that aims to reduce the screen time users spend. The challenge grows in the face of covid where
            screen time often provides the only outlet for users to interact with friends and family, an aspect
            undoubtedly paramount to better mental health, and one of the few sources of entertainment.
        </p>
        <h6 class="sub-title" style="margin-top: 30px">Our Solution</h6>
        <p>
            Any and all design solutions should always address the problem of increased screen time. It would be
            easy to just pack the app with features aimed at promoting a healthier lifestyle, like bombardment of
            notifications to log activities, track mental health or suggestions like journaling. However, this
            defeats the purpose as the user must spend an increased amount of time using the app. Instead we
            aim to identify the absolutely crucial tasks that the users must engage in, which would ensure the
            highest amount of time away from the screens, and yet would have the highest positive impact on mental
            and physical health.

            <h4 id="research" class="header-text">Research</h4>
            <p>
                Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone’s daily routine has changed. Whether people
                study from home in front of their computers or they work remotely, almost all their daily tasks
                require a screen. Even though the concept of lifestyle apps are not new, we found flaws and
                features that were not crucial for most users.
            </p>

            <h6 class="sub-title">OTHER APPS</h6>

            <h6 class="sub-title">QUESTIONNAIRE</h6>
            <p>
                The goal of our app is to encourage users to focus on fulfilling basic needs.
                After gathering the responses, we noticed that most people spend the majority
                of their time in front of screens for entertainment and work. According to Maslow’s
                Hierarchy of Needs, the foundation tier is physiological such as food, water,
                sleep, and warmth. Though we had an idea of incorporating these needs as features,
                it was vital to prove a strong correlation between the users’ necessities and
                our assumptions. The main features are loosely based on these essentials that
                most of us neglect daily due to the current state of the world.

            <h6 class="sub-title">INTERVIEWS</h6>
            <p>
                The next step of validating our users was to create personas and trying to
                discover what drives them. Our interview questions were conducted with an
                audience of 18 people. The proposed questions will be used as segments for
                the personas. We focused on the goals, frustrations, interests, and ways of
                improving mental health to envision the types of users for LUMI. To be more
                inclusive of the preferences among users, we added several other features such
                as journaling, medicine, and mood tracker. LUMI will encourage users to
                customize what makes them happy and will manage all they do to attain that
                aim with its multiple features.

                    As we were discussing possible design and feature ideas, we went through multiple iterations to
                    perfect a solid foundation for LUMI. The sketches allowed us to have a concrete idea of basic
                    designs such as navbar, calendars, checklists, and covers for our main pages.

                    The wireframes below is simply an extension of the sketches made earlier. They were created right
                    after finalizing the layout for several components and had a deeper understanding of the features
                    LUMI will provide.

                    The user flow was a useful visual representation that we created to answer both logical and design
                    concerns. There were many questions posed during team discussions to comprehend and be mindful of
                    the user experience. The diagram was formed while responding to concerns such as: logical flow
                    between frames, creative transitions that might confuse users, and avoiding an overwhelming amount
                    of menu options.

                    We agreed the color blue which is the theme for LUMI incorporates the following hues. White
                    complements
                    the darker shades of our palette. Blue is a calming color that promotes serenity and stability.
                    It also symbolizes wisdom, depth of understanding, and introspective journey.
